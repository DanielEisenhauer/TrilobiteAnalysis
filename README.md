# TrilobiteAnalysis
Projects a deformable template of a Corynexochid pygidium and saves waypoint data

The purpose of this program is to collect morphometric data from trilobites. Right now the template is designed for Corynexochid pygidia, but future updates will add support for Corynexochid and Redlichiid cranidia, and possibly other trilobite orders as well; the system could also be adapted for templates of many other things.
